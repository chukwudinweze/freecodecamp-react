I started learning reactjs, hoping to build a full functional website with it. this will serve as a documentation of my journey to being a senior react developer


#Here is a new update to my journey
Today, haven learnt the basics of reactjs like:
# JSX
# How rendering works
# Virtual DOM
# Components, 
# Events, 
# Props,
# Separation of concerns,
# Modularize code in react,
# Significance of keys in reactjs

I'm going to discontinue this repo to open a new one where i will learn the advanced react concept and hopefully use it to build mega websites.

https://www.edfright.netlify.app , http://www.nutrifood.netlify.app are some of the sites I built with html, pure css and vanilla Js. Hopefully I'll redesign it with reactjs
